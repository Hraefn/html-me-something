            <h2>Goodbye, St. Louis!</h2>
            <p> We are packed and ready for an adventure! This is the first major vacation my husband and I have 
                had without the kids. Needless to say, we are super stoked! We left St. Louis about 8:00 p.m. on 
                November 1st. We drove through the night and stopped for a brief nap at a rest stop somewhere in 
                Nebraska before powering on.</p>
            <a name="day2"></a>
            <h2>Whoa, Nebraska, Wyoming, Utah, and Nevada!</h2> <h3>I need an oil change...</h3>
            <p>Uh, well, we did a little driving! We stopping for some offroad adventures in Wyoming, but the rest 
                of the day was spent talking and staring at highways. Utah's Salt Lake was really pretty!</p> 
            <a name="day3"></a>
            <h2>We made it to the tide pools!</h2>
            <p> I love my car, but after 30+ hours we were both ready to be pretty much anywhere else. There's 
                only so much "I Spy" one can play, you know? I'm kidding, but we were pretty shellshocked by the 
                time we made it to the California coast. We watched the sunset on the beach and marveled at the 
                sight and smell of the ocean. It was really cool to see all the little critters in the tide pools 
                at Duxbury Reef. </p>

            <h2>Happy Anniversary!</h2> <h3>Stinson Beach, Half Moon Bay kayaking, Mission District street hotdogs,
                and Chabot Space Museum!</h3>
            <p>Stinson Beach might be my favorite place in the world. There was a high surf warning on November 4th, 
                and the waves were colossal! We watched the surfers and played in the waves for a good part of the 
                morning, and then we headed to Half Moon Bay to rent some kayaks.  We wandered around San Francisco 
                and ended up in the Mission District. We ate a ridiculously delcious street hot dog and picked up 
                Mission Minis cupcakes to celebrate our big day.  Chabot Space Center had a special event with a 
                few different telescope viewings, and we got to see Epsilon Lyrae, the famous "double double" star. 
                We had a great time talking shop with other astronomy fanatics, I talked to a robot, and I saw 
                Einstein's telescope. SO AWESOME! </p>

            <h2>>Hey, big trees!</h2> <h3>Also, seagulls LOVE sweet potato fries!</h3>
            <p> Day 5 we hiked Mount Tamalpais and spent a few peaceful hours at Muir Woods. We stopped at Muir 
                Beach and I got to build a few little rock cairns, it's a thing I do. We stayed a while for guitar
                music and a bonfire, then we went back to Stinson Beach for seafood nachos. Seagulls stole our sweet 
                potato fries while we were busy watching the stars. We didn't really mind.</p>
            <a name="day6"></a>
            <h2>San Francisco Tea Festival, The Golden Gate Bridge, and Half Dome!</h2>
            <p> For our last day in San Francisco we went to Fisherman's Warf for the International Tea Festival,
                there were SO many people! We ate tea, we drank tea, we took all kinds of tea home, it was glorious!
                There was a farmer's market right next door, we had schwarma and dumplings for lunch, and we bought 
                chocolate sourdough and homemade jam for breakfast the next day. We hiked around Fort Baker and 
                admired the Golden Gate bridge. We were trying to wait out Tioga Road's closure due to snow so we 
                could drive a straight shot to Yosemite, but no such luck, we packed up and set a course to Death 
                Valley. The next day the road was reopened, wah wah wah. </p>  

            <a name="day7"></a>
            <h2>Death Valley, Las Vegas, and Zion!</h2>
            <p> We drove long, deserted highways through the night. We pulled over and spent some time on top of my
                car admiring the most amazing star-filled sky. I've never seen so many shooting stars! We slept for
                a few hours and watched the sunrise over the desert sands the next morning. We didn't adventure too 
                far off the path for once, but we did make it to Badwater Basin, the lowest point in the US.  We 
                only spent a couple of hours there early in the morning, but eve so, the temperature climbed into 
                the 90's. Our trip down the Las Vegas strip was fun, such a crazy, busy town!  We briefly thought
                about finding a little chapel to renew our vows, but we were eager to head to Zion. We got to 
                Zion kind of late in the day, so we didn't get to do as much hiking as we wanted and we totally 
                missed our appointment to hike The Narrows, but it was a beautiful park and I can't wait to go 
                back. </p>    
             
            <a name="day8"></a>
            <h2>Bryce Canyon, Arches, Canyonlands, and Moab!</h2>
            <p> Bryce Canyon was the park I had been waiting for, and we had Ben and Jerry's for breakfast to 
                celebrate! The colors were amazing and hiking amongst the Hoodoo Spires fulfilled a promise I made 
                to myself when worked at The Alpine Shop the year we got married. We settled in in Moab and spent 
                most of the day at Arches, Capitol Reef, Kodachrome Basin, and Escalante. We did some offroading and ate at the 
                Moab Diner, which was highly spoken of by the REI team we met in Death Valley.  We went to 
                Canyonlands after dinner and set up our camera for some long exposure night sky photos, it was 
                breathtaking. We woke up the next morning to hear that Trump won the election... it was a pretty 
                somber ride to Colorado. </p>      
                    
            <a name="day9"></a>
            <h2>Valley View hot springs, Great Sand Dunes, Medano Pass, and a loooooong trip home!</h2>
            <p> We rolled into Valley View fairly late, but we still had plenty of time to enjoy much needed dip
                in the tranquil hot springs. It was absolutely blissful to relax and let sore muscles unwind after 
                so many days of camping, hiking, and driving. The next day we timed it so we could see Great Sand 
                Dunes as the sun came up, the humming sound the dunes make is really eery. At this point we were 
                ready to head home.  We made the mistake of listening to Google and set out through Medano Pass.  
                We didn't realize that it was a sand and rock 4X4 trail winding through the Sangre de Christo 
                mountains that crosses Medano Creek several times and meanders through many acres previously burned 
                in a forest fire in 2010. It was a slow crawl over rocky outcroppings, but eventually we made it... 
                to the absolute middle of nowhere! We took a few more inadvertent detours, but we finally found 
                Highway 70 and it was a straight shot home.</p>
            <p> I was overjoyed to see our boys again! We spent a lot of time with no phone signal, and Snapchat 
                pics just aren't the same as having their sweet faces in front of me. Next summer the six of us are 
                gearing up for pretty much the same trip.  Here's hoping we all survive! </p>
