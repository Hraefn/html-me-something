        <p> To celebrate our 15th anniversary, my husband Scott 
            and I undertook an epic adventure to the Pacific 
            Ocean. </p>

            <h2>Goodbye, St. Louis!</h2>
            <p> We are packed and ready for an adventure! This is the first major vacation my husband and I have 
                had without the kids. Needless to say, we are super stoked! We left St. Louis about 8:00 p.m. on 
                November 1st. We drove through the night and stopped for a brief nap at a rest stop somewhere in 
                Nebraska before powering on.</p>

            <h2>Whoa, Nebraska, Wyoming, Utah, and Nevada! I need an oil change...</h2>
            <p>Uh, well, we did a little driving, only stopping for some offroad adventures in Wyoming. Salt Lake
                was really pretty!</p>

            <h2>We made it to the tide pools!</h2>
            <p> I love my car, but after 30+ hours we were both ready to be pretty much anywhere else. There's 
                only so much "I Spy" one can play, you know? We watched the sunset on the beach and marveled at 
                the sight and smell of the ocean. It was really cool to see all the little critters in the tide 
                pools at Duxbury Reef. </p>

            <h2>Happy Anniversary! Stinson Beach, Half Moon Bay kayaking, Mission District street hotdogs, and 
                Chabot Space Museum!</h2>
            <p>Stinson Beach is probably my favorite place in the world. There was a high surf warning and the 
                waves were epic.  We watched the surfers and played in the waves, and then we headed to Half Moon 
                Bay to rent some kayaks.  We
