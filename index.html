            <h2>Goodbye, St. Louis!</h2>
            <p> We are packed and ready for an adventure! This is the first major vacation my husband and I have 
                had without the kids. Needless to say, we are super stoked! We left St. Louis about 8:00 p.m. on 
                November 1st. We drove through the night and stopped for a brief nap at a rest stop somewhere in 
                Nebraska before powering on.</p>

            <h2>Whoa, Nebraska, Wyoming, Utah, and Nevada!</h2> <h3>I need an oil change...</h3>
            <p>Uh, well, we did a little driving! We stopping for some offroad adventures in Wyoming, but the rest 
                of the day was spent talking and staring at highways. Utah's Salt Lake was really pretty!</p>

            <h2>We made it to the tide pools!</h2>
            <p> I love my car, but after 30+ hours we were both ready to be pretty much anywhere else. There's 
                only so much "I Spy" one can play, you know? I'm kidding, but we were pretty shell-shocked by the 
                time we made it to the California coast. We watched the sunset on the beach and marveled at the 
                sight and smell of the ocean. It was really cool to see all the little critters in the tide pools 
                at Duxbury Reef. </p>

            <h2>Happy Anniversary!</h2> <h3>Stinson Beach, Half Moon Bay kayaking, Mission District street hotdogs,
                and Chabot Space Museum!</h3>
            <p>Stinson Beach might be my favorite place in the world. There was a high surf warning on November 4th, 
                and the waves were colossal! We watched the surfers and played in the waves for a good part of the 
                morning, and then we headed to Half Moon Bay to rent some kayaks.  We wandered around San Francisco 
                and ended up in the Mission District. I'm not normally a big fan, but we bought what turned out to 
                be a ridiculously delcious street hot dog, and then we picked up Mission Minis cupcakes to celebrate 
                our big day.  Chabot Space Center in Oakland had a special event with a few different telescope 
                viewings, and we got to see Epsilon Lyrae, the famous "double double" star. We had a great time 
                talking shop with other astronomy fanatics. Plus, I talked to a robot, got some tips on how to 
                grind a lens for my Dobsonian, AND I saw Einstein's telescope, So awesome! </p>

            <h2>>Hey, big trees!</h2> <h3>Also, seagulls love sweet potato fries!</h3>
            <p> Day 5 we hiked Mount Tamalpais and spent a few peaceful hours at Muir Woods. We stopped at Muir 
                Beach and I got to build a few little rock cairns, it's a thing I like to do. We stayed a while for 
                guitar music and a bonfire, then we went back to Stinson Beach for seafood nachos. Seagulls stole 
                our sweet potato fries while we were busy watching the stars. We didn't really mind.</p>

            <h2>San Francisco International Tea Festival, The Golden Gate Bridge, and Half Dome!</h2>
            <p> For our last day in San Francisco we went to Fisherman's Wharf for the International Tea Festival.
                There were SO many people! We ate tea, we drank tea, we took all kinds of tea home, it was glorious!
                There was a farmer's market right next door, we had schwarma and dumplings for lunch, and we bought 
                chocolate sourdough and homemade jam for breakfast the next day. We hiked around Fort Baker and 
                admired the Golden Gate bridge. We were trying to wait out Tioga Road's closure due to snow so we 
                could drive a straight shot to Yosemite, but no such luck. We packed up and set a course to Death 
                Valley. We made it to Yosemite as the sun was setting, which was a little disappointing, but we did
                see Half Dome. We'll make more time next trip. Tioga Road was reopened the next day. (Wah wah wah.) 
            </p>

            <h2>Death Valley, Las Vegas, and Zion!</h2>
            <p> We drove long, deserted highways through the night. We pulled over around 2 a.m. and spent some time 
                on top of my car admiring the brilliant, star-dappled sky. I've never seen so many shooting stars! 
                We slept for a few hours and watched the sunrise over the desert sands the next morning. We didn't 
                adventure too far off the path for once, but we did make it to Badwater Basin, the lowest point in 
                North America.  We only spent a couple of hours there early in the morning, but even so, the 
                temperature climbed into the 90s. Our trip down the Las Vegas strip was fun, such a crazy, busy 
                town!  We briefly thought about finding a little chapel to renew our vows, but we were eager to 
                head to Zion. We got to Zion kind of late in the day, so we didn't get to do as much hiking as we 
                wanted. We totally missed our appointment to hike The Narrows, but it was a beautiful park and I 
                can't wait to go back. </p>

            <h2>Bryce Canyon, Moab, and Canyonlands!</h2>
            <p> Bryce Canyon was the park I had been waiting for, and we had Ben and Jerry's for breakfast to 
                celebrate! The colors were amazing and hiking amongst the Hoodoo Spires fulfilled a promise I made 
                to myself when I was working at The Alpine Shop the same year we got married. We settled in in Moab 
                and spent most of the day at Capitol Reef, Kodachrome Basin, and Escalante. We did some 
                offroading and ate at the Moab Diner, which was highly spoken of by the REI team we met in Death 
                Valley.  We went to Canyonlands after dinner and set up our camera for some long exposure night sky 
                photos, it was breathtaking. We woke up the next morning to hear that Trump won the election... it 
                was a pretty somber ride to Colorado. </p>

            <h2>Arches, Valley View hot springs.</h2>
            <p> We spent most of the day exploring the pocket canyons and primitive sand trails in Arches, it was 
                really hard to leave and start the journey back to reality. We rolled into Valley View fairly late, 
                but we still had plenty of time to enjoy much needed dip in the tranquil hot springs. It was 
                absolutely blissful to relax and let sore muscles unwind after so many days of camping, hiking, and 
                driving. </p>

            <h2>Great Sand Dunes, Medano Pass, and a loooooong trip home!</h2>    
                The next day we timed it so we could see Great Sand Dunes as the sun came up, the humming 
                sound the dunes make is really eery. We packed up and got ready to head home.  This was when we made
                the mistake of listening to Google which recommended Medano Pass as the quickest way home.  We didn't 
                realize that it was a sand and rock 4X4 trail winding up and over the Sangre de Christo mountains. 
                We crossed Medano Creek several times and meandered through acres of tress burned in a forest fire 
                in 2010. I was a little stressed, but Scott had the time of his life! It was a slow crawl over rocky
                outcroppings, but eventually we made it... to the absolute middle of nowhere. We took a few more 
                inadvertent detours, but we finally found Highway 70 and it was a straight shot home.</p>
            <p> I was overjoyed to see our boys again! We spent a lot of time with no phone signal, and Snapchat 
                pics just aren't the same as having their sweet faces in front of me. Next summer the six of us are 
                gearing up for pretty much the same trip as a last hurrah before our oldest graduates.  I hope they 
                will make as many fond memories as Scott and I have now!
